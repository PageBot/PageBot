<h1>PageBot Version 0.6</h1>
<h2>What is PageBot?</h2>
<p>PageBot is a page layout program, that enables designers to create high quality documents using code. <br />
It is available both as Python library context for <a href="https://www.drawbot.com">DrawBot</a> and as part of a collection of stand-alone desktop applications that can be created from it. </p>
<p>Initiated by <a href="https://typetr.typenetwork.com">TYPETR</a>, the aim is to create a system for scriptable applications generating high quality typographic documents for a variety of output media, that support high quality fonts.</p>
<p>PageBot is available under MIT Open Source license from <a href="https://github.com/PageBot/PageBot">github.com/PageBot/PageBot</a></p>
<p>A manual, generated automatically with PageBot, is at <a href="https://typenetwork.github.io/PageBot">typenetwork.github.io/PageBot</a></p>
<p>An example website generated automatically with PageBot, is at <a href="http://designdesign.space">designdesign.space</a> which also includes entry points for studies and workshops how to work with PageBot.</p>
<p>The TYPETR Upgrade website <a href="https://upgrade.typenetwork.com">upgrade.typenetwork.com</a> is an example where the webiste and all illustrations/animations are generated by PageBot scripts.</p>
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>Although publicly available as Open Source under an MIT license, PageBot is still in a testing/alpha phase.<br />
More examples need to be created to fully test all functions.</p>
<pre><code>page = page.next # Go to the next page and select the box
box = page.select('main')
</code></pre>

<p>An overview of PageBot functions reads like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various types of Element objects can be placed on a page or inside other Element objects.</li>

<li>All image filtering supplied by Drawbot ImageObject.</li>
<li>Access and modify images on pixel-level.</li>
<li>Cascading styles, where Element values inherit from parent Elements, similar to CSS behavior.   </li>
<li>Text flows are using the macOS FormattedString for all typographic parameters.</li>
<li>Random Text generator for headlines and articles.</li>
<li>Read text from MarkDown and XML (.MD .XML)</li>

<li>Access to all font metrics.</li>
<li>Outline Font access modification.</li>
<li>Space, groups and kerning access and modifcation.</li>
<li>OT layout and feature access and modification.</li>
