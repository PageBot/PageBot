# PageBotApp

Needing further development, the PageBotApp allows designers to package scripts for specific publications (UI, parametric definintion of styles) frozen as double click application. 

This way designs can be supplied to customers, who then can create publications that fit their identities, while adding variable content in text and images. All without the use of InDesign and open template documents.
