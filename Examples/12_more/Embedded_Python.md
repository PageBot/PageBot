# Embedded Python
The connection between Markdown content and Python can be made from 2 different directions. 

* PageBot application scripts that create a **Document** instance with templates, elements and typesetters that parse Markdown text.
* MarkDown text files that include Python code to create documents.

For example, you can execute Python code from MarkDown like this:

~~~Python
cid = 'Document'
from pagebot.document import Document
doc = Document(w=400, h=600, title='TestContent')
~~~	

The **Typesetter**, reading this Markdown file, will generate this dictionary as result:

~~~
{'Document': {'doc': <pagebot.document.Document object at 0x119037c10>,
 'Document': <class 'pagebot.document.Document'>, 'id': 'Document'},
  'Views': {'aa': 123, 'cc': ['List', 'of', 'things'], 'id': 'Views',
   'bb': 234}}
~~~

The resulting dictionary contains Python code blocks, indicated by a triple “~” tilde. Because there's no “Python” after the triple tilde, the codeblock will be further ignored by the **Typesetter**.
If the code block contains a **cid = 'NameOfCodeBlock'** (“cid” is short for “codeId”), then this value is taken as name for the result dictionary.

A code block can contain any kind of Python code. Any “globally” created object will become an entry in the resulting dictionary.

~~~Python
cid = 'Views' # Defines id for this code block result.
aa = 123
bb = 234
cc = ['List', 'of', 'things']
~~~	

~~~Python
cid = 'Views'
dd = 567
~~~
