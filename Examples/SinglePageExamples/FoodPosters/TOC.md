# FoodPoster Examples
The FoodPoster series is not intended to show great designs, as the scripts are presented here. They are exercise material, used at the Master 1 assignment in the St.Joost Graphic Design class.

##DB_FoodPoster.py (DrawBot)
Generates a 3 column poster about 7 types of pasta, using only DrawBot functions. It is a excercse sketch result, where elements roughly still overlap. The scripts shows principles how typographic values can make dependent by algorithm. Values van be changed (such as ize of the page, number of columns, size of the margins, fonts and font size.

Since there is no direct way in plain DrawBot to know if elements overlap, or what should be done if they do, it would need a lot of specific coding to give each images and caption its own space.
The “conditions” in PageBot give better control on what happens if elements do overlap.

##DB_FoodPosters.py (DrawBot)
Does mostly the same thing as *DB_FoodPoster.py*, except tha multiple pages are generated with different backgrounds. Fake text is randomized in volume and structure between the captions.

*More examples to be added using PageBot conditional layouts.*
