### dict __builtins__
dict() -> new empty dictionary
dict(mapping) -> new dictionary initialized from a mapping object's
(key, value) pairs
dict(iterable) -> new dictionary initialized as if via:
d = {}
for k, v in iterable:
d[k] = v
dict(**kwargs) -> new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs
in the keyword argument list.  For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
### __doc__
### str __file__
str(object='') -> string

Return a nice string representation of the object.
If the argument is a string, the return value is the same object.
### str __name__
str(object='') -> string

Return a nice string representation of the object.
If the argument is a string, the return value is the same object.
### str __package__
str(object='') -> string

Return a nice string representation of the object.
If the argument is a string, the return value is the same object.
### def distance
Answers the distance between the points.
### def dotProduct
### def insideCircle

    >>> insideCircle(1, 1, 5)
    True

    >>> insideCircle(3, 3, 3)
    False
### def intersection
Returns 2D intersection point if it exists. Otherwise (None, None,
None) is answered. Different from the RoboFont intersection tool, we
intersect on infinite line lengths. See also:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-line_intersection
### def isBetween
Checks if point is on line between line endpoints. Uses epsilon
margin for float values, can be substituted by zero for integer
values.
### def isEven

    >>> isEven(2)
    True

    >>> isEven(1)
    False
### def isOdd

    >>> isOdd(1)
    True

    >>> isOdd(2)
    False
### def lucasRange
Answers the range stem widths for interpolation, according to
Lucasâ€™ formula.

http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/interpolation-theory/
a = minStem
z = maxStem
n = number of interpolated stems, including the two masters
minN = optional minimum value if normalizing, e.g. 0-1000
maxN = optional maximum value if normalizing

print Mathematics.lucasRange(32, 212, 8)
[32, 42, 55, 72, 94, 124, 162, 212]

print Mathematics.lucasRange(32, 212, 8, 0, 1000)
[0, 55, 127, 222, 346, 508, 721, 1000]

print Mathematics.lucasRange(32, 212, 8, 100, 200)
[100, 106, 113, 122, 135, 151, 172, 200]
### def normalize
### normalizedVector
classmethod(function) -> method

Convert a function to be a class method.

A class method receives the class as implicit first argument,
just like an instance method receives the instance.
To declare a class method, use this idiom:

  class C:
  def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...): ...
  f = classmethod(f)

It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class.
If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class
object is passed as the implied first argument.

Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods.
If you want those, see the staticmethod builtin.
### def point2D
Answer the 2D origin as combination of p and offset.
### def point2Line
Answers the distance from point <i>(px, py)</i> to line <i>((x1,
y1), (x2, y2))</i>.
### def pointProjectedOnLine
Answers the projected point <b>(px, py)</b> on line <b>((x1, y1), (x2,
y2))</b>.  Answers <b>(x1, y1)</b> if there is not distance between the two
points of the line.
### def scalePointByVector
### def scalexy
### def squareDistance
Answers the square of the distance for relative comparison and to
save the time of the <b>sqrt</b>.
### def test
### def vectorLength
