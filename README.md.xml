<document><h1>PageBot Version 0.5</h1>
<h2>What is PageBot?</h2>
<p>PageBot is a page layout program, that enables designers to create high quality documents using code. <br />
It is available both as Python library inside <a href="https://www.drawbot.com">DrawBot</a> and as part of a collection of stand-alone desktop applications that can be created from it. </p>
<p>Initiated by <a href="https:/typenetwork.com">Type Network</a>, our aim is to create a system for scriptable applications generating high quality typographic documents that support high quality fonts.</p>
<p>PageBot is available under MIT Open Source license from <a href="https://github.com/TypeNetwork/PageBot">github.com/TypeNetwork/PageBot</a></p>
<p>A manual, generated automatically with PageBot, is at <a href="https://typenetwork.github.io/PageBot">typenetwork.github.io/PageBot</a></p>
<p>A website generated automatically with PageBot, is at <a href="http://designdesign.space">designdesign.space</a> which also includes entry points for studies and workshops how to work with PageBot.</p>
<p>The TYPETR Upgrade website <a href="https://upgrade.typenetwork.com">upgrade.typenetwork.com</a> is an example where all illustrations are generated by PageBot scripts.</p>
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>Although publicly available as Open Source under an MIT license, PageBot is still in a testing/alpha phase.<br />
More examples need to be created to fully test all functions.</p>
<p>For further development, the contribution of others is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Known bugs and missing functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image + Pixelmap + Caption elements have some scaling problems.</li>
<li>Reading XML text from markdown is missing Document styles.</li>
<li>Better management of text baselines on pages and throughout documents.</li>
<li>More useful views (representations of Documents) need to be developed and tested.</li>
<li>Currently, not all scripts in the Examples directory work properly, due to late changes in the PageBot core.</li>
<li>Windows, GNU+Linux and Android users are not yet supported (see <a href="https://github.com/TypeNetwork/PageBot/issues/40">issue #40</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>An overview of PageBot functions reads like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various types of Element objects can be placed on a page or inside other Element objects.</li>
<li>Grids can be defined through style measurements and views.</li>
<li>Page templates (or templates for any other element combination) can be defined and applied.</li>
<li>Automatic layout conditions for elements, like even distribution across or floating down parent elements.</li>
<li>Specialized views on a Document, such as plain pages, spreads and other layout of page groups, optional with crop-marks, registration-mark, color-strips, file name, etc. The result of all views can be placed on pages as illustration.</li>
<li>Graphics - using all Drawbot drawing tools.</li>
<li>All image filtering supplied by Drawbot ImageObject.</li>
<li>Access and modify images on pixel-level.</li>
<li>Cascading styles, where Element values inherit from parent Elements, similar to CSS behavior.   </li>
<li>Text flows are using the macOS FormattedString for all typographic parameters.</li>
<li>Random Text generator for headlines and articles.</li>
<li>Read text from MarkDown and XML (.MD .XML)</li>
<li>Support large amount of text processing functions:</li>
<li>centered, left, right and justified</li>
<li>Text to fit a box and elastic box to fit text</li>
<li>Tabular setting</li>
<li>Text Flow from one element to another. </li>
<li>Variable Font UI access and instance creation, as the whole "fonttools" Python library is available.</li>
<li>Access to all font metrics.</li>
<li>Outline Font access modification.</li>
<li>Space, groups and kerning access and modifcation.</li>
<li>OT layout and feature access and modification.</li>
<li>3D Positioning of points, for future usage.</li>
<li>Motion Graphics, export as animated .gif and .mov files, keyframing timeline, </li>
<li>Export to PDF, PNG, JPG, SVG, (animated) GIF, MOV, XML, through programmable views.</li>
<li>Build web sites, pre-compiling all images used into the formats that can be displayed by browsers (.PNG .JPG .SVG)</li>
<li>Automatic table of contents, image references, quote references, etc. from composed documents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>All PageBot source code is available as open source under the MIT license. </p>
<p>However, some other separate works are aggregated in this repository for convenience, and available under their own licenses. <br />
See LICENSE files for details. </p>
<h2>Future developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Element classes supporting various types of graphs, info-graphics, maps, PageBot document layout, Variable Font axes layout, font metrics.</li>
<li>Views for thumbnail page overview, combined booklet-sheets for print, site-maps, etc.</li>
<li>Add export of text to MarkDown .md files.</li>
<li>Add export to online documents, such as HTML/CSS/JS for specific designs of web pages, such as Kirby.</li>
<li>Export to WordPress® PHP sites.</li>
<li>Export to Ruby®/Sketchup® data files.</li>
<li>Add export to Angular® files.</li>
<li>Export to InDesign® and Illustrator®, as close as possible translating PageBot elements to the native file format of these applications.</li>
<li>Time line, definition and editing, length and fps.</li>
<li>Integrate the PageBot manual builder with other export functions of the library.</li>
<li>Add more unit-tests to guarantee the integrity of the library and output consistency.</li>
