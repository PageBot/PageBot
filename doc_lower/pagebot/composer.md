## Functions

### Composer
A Composer takes a galley and tries to make a “nice” layout (on existing or new document pages),
by taking the elements from the galley pasteboard and finding the best place in pages, e.g. in
page-flows that are copied from their templates.
If necessary elements can be split, new elements can be made on the page and element can be
reshaped byt width and height, if that results in better placements.
