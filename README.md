# What is PageBot®?

PageBot is a page layout program that enables designers to create high quality
documents using code. It is available both as Python library working with
[DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com) and as part of a collection of stand-alone
desktop applications that can be created from it. Other contexts such as
[Flat](http://xxyxyz.org/flat) (currently under development) allow PageBot to
run environments other Mac OS X, for example on web servers. Initiated by
[Type Network](https://typenetwork.com), the aim is to create a system for
scriptable applications generating professionally designed documents that use
high quality typography.

under MIT Open Source license from
[github.com/TypeNetwork/PageBotExamples](https://github.com/TypeNetwork/PageBotExamples)
- A manual, generated automatically with PageBot, is at
