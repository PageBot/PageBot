# What is PageBot®?

PageBot is a page layout program that enables designers to create high quality
documents using Python programming. It is available both as Python library
working with [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com) and as part of a collection of
stand-alone desktop applications. Other contexts such as
[Flat](http://xxyxyz.org/flat) and InDesign are currently being developed. They
will allow PageBot to output to print-ready formats and to run in environments
other than Mac OS X such as Posix web servers. The aim of the developers of
PageBot is to create a system of scriptable applications to generate
professionally designed documents that make use of high quality typography.

# Examples

- A growing library of real document examples are bundled in Examples, available
under MIT Open Source license from
[github.com/PageBot/PageBotExamples](https://github.com/PageBot/PageBotExamples)
- A manual, generated automatically with PageBot, is at
[pagebot.github.io/PageBot](https://pagebot.github.io/PageBot)
- A website fully generated with PageBot can be found at
[designdesign.space](http://designdesign.space). It also includes entry points
for studies and workshops on how to work with PageBot.
- The TYPETR Upgrade website
[upgrade.typenetwork.com](https://upgrade.typenetwork.com) is an example where
the HTML/CSS code and all illustrations are generated by PageBot scripts.

## Future Developments

  PageBot document layout, Variable Font axes layout, font metrics.
* Font class supporting CFF (.otf) and UFO.
* Views for thumbnail page overview, combined booklet-sheets for print,
  site-maps, etc.
* Add export of text to MarkDown .md files.
* Add export to online documents, such as HTML/CSS/JS for specific designs of
  web pages, such as Kirby.
* Export to WordPress® PHP sites.

* Integrate the PageBot manual builder with other export functions of the library.
* Add more unit-tests to guarantee the integrity of the library and output
  consistency.
* Automatic support of ornament frames, in connection to the Element borders
  and the layout of exiting (TN) border fonts.
