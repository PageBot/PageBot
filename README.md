## What is PageBot?

As short description PageBot is a scripted page layout program, available as Python library inside <a href="http:/drawbot.com">@DrawBotApp</a> and as a collection of stand-alone desktop applications.

An overview of functions reads like this:
* An increasing range of elements can be placed on a page.
* As pages are elements themselves, they can also be included in pages.
* Root style where all other values inherit from, similar to CSS behavior.
* Automatic layout conditions for elements
* All positioning is 3D
* Full access to font parameters and outlines
* Time line for all parameters, using time markers to interpolate over a give path and period.

* Add export to Angular files.
* Export to InDesign and Illustrator, as close as possible to the native file format.
