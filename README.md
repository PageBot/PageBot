* Content (such as text) flows from one textBox to another.
* Access to images on pixel-level.
* Page templates (or any other element combination)
* OSX FormattedString for text composition
* All positioning as 3D points, for future usage.
* Full access to parameters and outlines inside fonts
* Elements that show the content of (Variable) fonts.
* Time line to interpolate all values over a given path and period.
* Grids
* Random text generator
* All source code available.
* Open source under MIT conditions.
* All DrawBot functions accessable.
* Export to PDF, PNG, JPG, SVG, (animated) GIF, MOV, XML, through programmable views.
* Growing set of examples, templates and page elements with a specific task.-->

* Various types of Element objects can be placed on a page or inside other Element objects.
